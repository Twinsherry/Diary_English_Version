## Azusa's Chat with Amika

To be frank, I also thought about that these days. Not only my more attention on trans group, but also my aim of taking part in recollect passing stories. Now I draw a conclusion: Perhaps I just want to find my "sense".

What is my "sense"? During senior high school time, the *only* destination is only college entrance examination, and what I think more is about advanced chemistry course, and a vague mirror of a girl in my heart (may not a vague girl's mirror, calling her as "a silent girl" is better). After examination, the dream about Chemistry was in pieces, and my aim turned to "helping my family". My father always emphasized Chinese Medicine, and described its glorious future for me.

And we were finally on the same page. I said to myself I love Chinese medicine. I exaggerate that I must dig more in this province, I must find some amazing secrets. But now I realized that I just hoped to care more about my family, make them happy and cared less about their health, and my road would continue further more, this should be propped by a family who loved me. But after I expressed my sexual identity bravely, things worsened, and no matter what I worked hard on my studies, I couldn't see my future and brought satisfaction to my family. It seems that they won't love me as well as previous time.

So unconsciously, I invested more time to other people, including ungraduated senior high school students, and some heart-injured trans friends, and now I started to record passing stories.

BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?
