# Suzhou

## Forward Story

*Nashiro* arrived in Suzhou on 30th July. To tell the truth, she has a more special temperament which is different to what I imagined. More loveliness? Or more quietness? I could't describe that. I meet her in my dorm, then we walked through a short path, alongside a creek(æµœ) to the business block. 

Although I introduced my favourite Cantonese cuisine restaurant to her, but as the saying goes, one water live one people, I meant that it's awful to have hometown-dish out of town, so we had our dinner at a Thai style resaurant. The most [unforgotten] cuisine was a dish of ribs, it was different to chops in Cantonese cuisine. The ribs in the plate were uneven and large, so it was hard to eat gently. The taste was spicy, it was a strange feeling, and the taste would burnt stronger in the following seconds. Well, it was a 'hard cuisine' no matter how I describe it.

Her partner (tentatively using this state to call her)Qihuai would arrived at the railway station at midnight. We went to the hotel she stayed and recharge. Before that Qihuai said she had a cough so we went to the chemist to buy some medicine, although we buy it from takeout platform at last.

<!-- Incidentally, I saw that 'special toy'(with electricity) and experienced it a little bit, it amazed me a lot.  -->

At midnight *Nashiro* and I took a walk from the hotel to the station. The hotel is not so far from the station.

## Chapter0 A Hard Start

I'd told my mum that I want to have a trip to Xiamen and Guangdong before July starts, she approved but defered giving me funds. However, even before the day I hope to left Suzhou, she didn't reply to my request and I couldn't afford the fare actually. One probable reason is that she was hectic with the decorating new residence, and she have't enough flexible money in hand. Another reason is clear, she hated the action of not-going-home in her heart, so she chose a kind of cold violence to deal with me. I prefer to believe the former to the latter. 

In fact, in order to get more travelling funds, I didn't tell her about my underlying purpose, which is to meet parts of my best friends. I only gave her a made-up plan about my budget and route. In her eyes, it's a only trip to relax and view sightseeings. But for me, it's an obliged travel because the exist of magic in my hair would only last for another 5 months, and I hoped to meet my friend with my best appearance.

Fortunately, during my hardest time, *Yuki*-san, the host of Eyuki-Chasha, helped me to get the intial ticket (to Xiamen), so I set off in the next morning.

The luggage was packed, my heart was unquiet at night...
