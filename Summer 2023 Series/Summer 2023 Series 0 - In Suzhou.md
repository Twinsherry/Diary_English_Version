# Suzhou

## Forward Story: Meet

*Nashiro* arrived in Suzhou on 30th July. To tell the truth, she has a more special temperament which is different to what I imagined. More loveliness? Or more quietness? I could't describe that. I meet her in my dorm, then we walked through a short path, alongside a creek(浜) to the business block. 

Although I introduced my favourite Cantonese cuisine restaurant to her, but as the saying goes, one water live one people, I meant that it's awful to have hometown-dish out of town, so we had our dinner at a Thai style resaurant. The most [unforgotten] cuisine was a dish of ribs, it was different to chops in Cantonese cuisine. The ribs in the plate were uneven and large, so it was hard to eat gently. The taste was spicy, it was a strange feeling, and the taste would burnt stronger in the following seconds. Well, it was a 'hard cuisine' no matter how I describe it.

Her partner (tentatively using this state to call her)*Qihuai* would arrived at the railway station at midnight. We went to the hotel she stayed and recharge. Before that *Qihuai* said she had a cough so we went to the chemist to buy some medicine, although we buy it from takeout platform at last.

<!-- Incidentally, I saw that 'special toy'(with electricity) and experienced it a little bit, it amazed me a lot.  -->

At midnight *Nashiro* and I took a walk from the hotel to the station. It was not a far walk so we arrived suddenly. However, it might be dangerous for two girls walk out too late, so I kept an eye out for surroundings and I felt I was more bad-tempered to strangers, maybe I just wanted to protect my friends...

We waited her at the exit. Eventually, after successive crowd pulled out from the platform, I saw the appearance of her, that girl with short ponytail, and no sooner than she crossed the gate, she hugged with *Nashiro*. 

Two girls hugged intimately...a dreamy scene in my eyes. I promised that I would record those precious flash of my friends, so I pressed the shutter several times.

## Forward Story: Eel Paste Noodles

The second day we got up late and it's my time to back to dormitory to pick up my luggage for trip to Xiamen. Before that I remembered that there is a kind of Suzhou cuisine call *the oil ring eel paste (响油鳝糊)* . It's hard to order a takeout of such a cuisine notwithstanding, I chose *eel paste noodles (鳝糊面)* as a substitute and placed an order for my two friends.

While I was on the bus to my dormoitory, they recevied the takeout at the lobby of hotel.

"Did the noodles taste good？Did they add enough finless ell？" I asked in the phone. Although I was in Suzhou for almost 5 months, I still not taste this local speciality. It's clear that I was not only worried about the taste but also mind the [portion]. Fortunately they told me that they enjoyed their delicious meal.

Hither to, I haven't tried this famous cuisine, but I was pleasant because my friends had enjoyed it.

## Forward Story: A Hasty Farewell

A new month of Gregorian calendar started. 

July passed and August came, I experienced this process with my friends in Suzhou.

"When was the last time I felt so relaxed with my best friends in silence?" I thought, and fell asleep then.

In the morning I suggested two small Suzhou Classical Gardens to them, and we planed to get there by taxi, in view of the cost of ticket and my time to pick up luggage, I would find an entry of underground and backed.

Unfortunately my bag was distained by a chunk of chewing gum in the taxi, which smelled bad and stomach-churning. I had to get off the taxi in advance and cleaned my bag. I didn't even give my friend a proper goodbye or hug. 

The sky cried hours later, and they left Jiangsu for Zhejiang in the afternoon.

It was a hasty farewell, luckily the reunion would happen soon.

## Chapter0 A Hard Start

I'd told my mum that I want to have a trip to Xiamen and Guangdong before July starts, she approved but defered giving me funds. However, even before the day I hope to left Suzhou, she didn't reply to my request and I couldn't afford the fare actually. One probable reason is that she was hectic with the decorating new residence, and she have't enough flexible money in hand. Another reason is clear, she hated the action of not-going-home in her heart, so she chose a kind of cold violence to deal with me. I prefer to believe the former to the latter. 

In fact, in order to get more travelling funds, I didn't tell her about my underlying purpose, which is to meet parts of my best friends. I only gave her a made-up plan about my budget and route. In her eyes, it's a only trip to relax and view sightseeings. But for me, it's an obliged travel because the exist of magic in my hair would only last for another 5 months, and I hoped to meet my friend with my best appearance.

Fortunately, during my hardest time, *Yuki*-san, the host of [https://github.com/Samuyuki/Eyuki-Chasha](Eyuki-Chasha), helped me to get the intial ticket (to Xiamen), so I set off in the next morning.

The luggage was packed, my heart was unquiet at night...
